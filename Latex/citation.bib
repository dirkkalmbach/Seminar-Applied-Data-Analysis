    abstract = { Although there are many competing explanations for the Industrial Revolution, there has been no effort to evaluate them econometrically. This paper analyzes how the very different patterns of growth across the counties of England between the 1760s and 1830s can be explained by a wide range of potential variables. We find that industrialization occurred in areas that began with low wages but high mechanical skills, whereas other variables, such as literacy, banks, and proximity to coal, have little explanatory power. Against the view that living standards were stagnant during the Industrial Revolution, we find that real wages rose sharply in the industrializing north and declined in the previously prosperous south. }

abstract = {Abstract Using historical data for the 1700–1914 period, this paper analyses the nature and direction of technical change in Britain. The evidence in this paper indicates that, over this long period, labour-saving technology adoption was a major response to changes in relative factor prices, thus supporting the hypothesis that ‘induced innovation’ was a major driver of technical change during the British industrial revolution. Labour saving was made possible and sustained by capital-augmenting and energy-augmenting technical change coupled with continuous capital accumulation and abundant energy supplies. This process placed the British economy on a higher capital–labour ratio equilibrium, and was the primary force driving sustained productivity growth, which further raised wages and living standards.},

 abstract = {Recent estimates by Crafts, Leybourne, and Mills suggest that the rate of growth of British industrial production per head did not accelerate until after 1815. This is consistent with Harley's 1982 estimates but conflicts with Craft's 1985 estimates which show a transition to faster per caput growth in the late eighteenth century. This article argues that both the Harley and the Crafts, Leybourne, and Mills estimates are likely to understate industrial growth before 1815. Crafts appears to be nearer the mark though his estimates also have serious weaknesses. A new index is calculated for the period 1730-1830. Like its predecessors, the index is conjectural and rests on a slight foundation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new theory for why income inequality can be conducive to early industrial development. Technological advances in agriculture and population growth increase land rents relative to wages and as the landed elites become richer, demand for manufactured goods increases, which in turn facilitates industrialization. Using data for Britain over the period 1270–1940, we show that increasing inequality was a major contributor to the expansion of the manufacturing sector. Taking into account the more well-known drivers of modern growth, we find that inequality is a major contributor to the British Industrial Revolution, alongside foreign trade, education, technological knowledge and, to some extent, institutions.}

@book{Mokyr2010,
title = "The Enlightened economy an economic history of Britain 1700-1850",
abstract = "This book focuses on the importance of ideological and institutional factors in the rapid development of the British economy during the years between the Glorious Revolution and the Crystal Palace Exhibition. Joel Mokyr shows that we cannot understand the Industrial Revolution without recognizing the importance of the intellectual sea changes of Britain's Age of Enlightenment. In a vigorous discussion, Mokyr goes beyond the standard explanations that credit geographical factors, the role of markets, politics, and society to show that the beginnings of modern economic growth in Britain depended a great deal on what key players knew and believed, and how those beliefs affected their economic behavior. He argues that Britain led the rest of Europe into the Industrial Revolution because it was there that the optimal intersection of ideas, culture, institutions, and technology existed to make rapid economic growth achievable. His wide-ranging evidence covers sectors of the British economy often neglected, such as the service industries.",
